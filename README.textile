An ActiveFedora mixin that allows a datastream dissemination response to be streamed back in blocks without reading all content into memory.

Include the mixin in your ActiveFedora::Datastream subclass:

bc. class BigData < ActiveFedora::Datastream
  include ActiveFedora::Datastreams::Streamable
end

bc. class DataContainer < ActiveFedora::Base
  has_file_datastream :name=>'bigData', :type=> BigData
end

and then set the response_body in your controller:

bc. DataContainer.find('demo:1').bigData.stream(self)

The iterator returned from #stream will write the bytes of a datastream dissemination back to the client in segments, without reading all of the content into memory first.  It will not assign the output of the datastream dissemination to the ActiveFedora::Datastream's content attribute.
